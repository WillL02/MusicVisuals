# Description of the assignment
Our groups visualizer is based on an old computer that runs on Windows 95, there are 3 .exe files that clickable. When clicked each .exe file will run its own unique visualizer. The first visualizer "visual1.exe" plays a sped up version of the song "Safe and Sound by Capital Cities". The second visualizer "visual2.exe" plays the song "Heathens by Twenty one pilots". The third and final visualizer "visual3.exe" plays a slowed bass boosted remix of the song "Freaks by Timmy Trumpet".

# Instructions
Run the program and simply click on any three of the available visualizers once to watch. If you wish to stop at any point press the Exit icon located on the bottom right of the screen and it will bring you back to the computer.
