# Description of the assignment
Our groups visualizer is based on an old computer that runs on Windows 95, there are 3 .exe files that clickable. When clicked each .exe file will run its own unique visualizer. The first visualizer "visual1.exe" plays a sped up version of the song "Safe and Sound by Capital Cities". The second visualizer "visual2.exe" plays the song "Heathens by Twenty one pilots". The third and final visualizer "visual3.exe" plays a slowed bass boosted remix of the song "Freaks by Timmy Trumpet".

# Instructions
Run the program and simply click on any three of the available visualizers once to watch. If you wish to stop at any point press the Exit icon located on the bottom right of the screen and it will bring you back to the computer.

# How it works
The monitor screen works as a base for all the visualizers to be played.

# Máte
Write about how your visualizer works here. Remove heading once finished. Write in order of appearance.

# Ciaran
After being called from the Monitor, the Heathens file is run. My AudioVisual has multiple beat drops (6 in total) in which something in the visual will change. From the start there is a circle and a rain visual that reacts with the song. The circle gets larger and the rain falls faster depending on the song. The first drop of the song changes the color of the background, circle and rain. The second drop starts the rectangle visual where the whole screen zooms in while rectangles are drawn creating the effect of a rectangle slowly becoming smaller. The third drop then starts to zoom the screen out while the rectangle becomes bigger with a circle in the middle of the rectangle reacting to the music. The fourth drop returns to the bouncing circle and rain just as the rectangle is about to fill the screen. The fifth drop is another color change and the final sixth drop flashes the screen white to simulate a lightning strike.
